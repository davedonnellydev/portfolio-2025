# SocialProof Component Removal

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary

The SocialProof component has been completely removed from the portfolio as it was not needed for this project.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Component Files Deleted
- `components/home/SocialProof/SocialProof.tsx`
- `components/home/SocialProof/SocialProof.module.css`
- `components/home/SocialProof/index.ts`
- `components/home/SocialProof/types.ts`

### 2. ✅ Data Files Deleted
- `data/socialProof.ts`

### 3. ✅ Code References Removed

**Home Page** (`app/page.tsx`):
- Removed `SocialProof` import
- Removed `socialProofData` import
- Removed `<SocialProof {...socialProofData} />` component usage

**Root Layout** (`app/layout.tsx`):
- Removed github-calendar CSS link
- Removed github-calendar script tag

**Analytics** (`lib/analytics.ts`):
- Updated `trackGitHubClick` to remove `'social-proof'` location option
- Now only accepts `'footer'` as location

### 4. ✅ Documentation Updated

**FROSTED_GLASS_READABILITY.md**:
- Marked SocialProof section as REMOVED
- Added removal date note
- Struck through implementation details

## Impact Analysis

### Build Size Impact
- **Before**: Home page 6.89 kB
- **After**: Home page 6.12 kB
- **Savings**: 0.77 kB (~11% reduction on home page)

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All other components work correctly

### Removed Dependencies (Next Step)

The github-calendar package is no longer needed and should be uninstalled:

```bash
npm uninstall github-calendar
```

This package was only used by the SocialProof component to display GitHub activity.

## Current Home Page Structure

After removal, the home page now has these sections (in order):

1. **Hero** - Introduction, photo, credibility points, CTAs
2. **Signature Projects** - Featured project showcase
3. **Why Hire Me** - Three pillars (Ship quickly, Communicate clearly, Leverage AI)
4. **Micro Bio** - Short bio with link to About page

## Verification Steps Completed

- [x] Removed all component files
- [x] Removed data files
- [x] Updated imports in home page
- [x] Removed github-calendar dependencies from layout
- [x] Updated analytics type signatures
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] Verified build compiles successfully
- [x] Verified no linting errors
- [x] Confirmed page bundle size reduced

## Next Steps

Run the following command to complete the cleanup:

```bash
npm uninstall github-calendar
```

This will remove the unused package from `package.json` and update `package-lock.json`.
